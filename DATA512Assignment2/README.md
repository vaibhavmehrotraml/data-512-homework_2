# Research Implications
A significant takeaway from this analysis was that despite the US being an economically and technologically advanced country, we see a lack of public articles and information about several regions across the country and a strong skew towards specific high population/highly dense regions, which might be for a variety of reasons. This sparks a follow-up research to conduct similar analyses on other countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Public data sources like Wikipedia suffer from implicit and explicit biases. In our case, the simple issue of a lack of articles about specific cities and states stands out, which is an implicit bias. The existence of explicit biases, such as ideological differences, would require further analysis.


- What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
I expected significant cities with many inhabitants and higher population densities to have better articles because of higher contributions from interested parties. I also expected the larger states, especially those with a prolific economy, to have better quantity and quality of articles than economically backward and otherwise smaller states. 

- What (potential) sources of bias did you discover during your data processing and analysis?
One of the most significant sources of bias in an open-source, crowd-sourced data source like Wikipedia is the skewed interest of contributors. People tend to write articles and contribute to topics of interest. In our specific case, people will tend to write more about their cities for various reasons; they might be more interested in doing so or simply because their knowledge only goes as far as their surroundings. This kind of implicit bias is very apparent in our analysis. You might notice that states like Nebraska had yet to be mentioned in the earlier crawl to get names of cities.

- What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?

Despite having biased data, Wikipedia is a publically available, barrier-free source of data with a plethora of information that would be ideal for making a foundational first-attempt analysis. Our analysis shows that Wikipedia is subject to some implicit bias of knowledge about certain cities/states not existing.
